This is a quickly made POC (Proof of conept) software to manage one week for workers and their tasks.
Features : 
- Update System
- Settings per INI file
- PHP SQL Backend
- Userlists 
- Font and Color adjustments per Form
- Logging for debugging and troubleshooting
- Encoded SSL connection to the server possible
- Spawn child instances to have multiple windows
- Set priority tasks
- Template based task creation
- Autosynch tasks


The Backend of the server is made with very basic SQL queries in php scripts to outsource communication.
Make sure to include anti SQL injection steps before using this publicly.
